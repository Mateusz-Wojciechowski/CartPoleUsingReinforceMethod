# CartPoleUsingReinforceMethod
Hello!

In this project I used the Reinforce Method for training a Cart Pole agent. Reinforce Method is a basic "Vanilla" policy gradient method, but its more than enough for such simple tasks. Cart Pole is en enviroment provided by OpenAI in their library Gymnasium which I have utilized. You can find files both for testing and training the agent. If you want to see the results straight away, run the JupyterNotebook I provided.
